# iOS Developer Test Task

### Task description 
Create an app that fetches and displays RSS feeds.

### Requirements
* Mostly we expect projects written in Objective-C, but an excellent Swift solution will be valued high. 
* Project must compile in any Xcode build of the latest major version without any additional setup or configuration. 
* App must support at least iOS 8 devices. 
* Feel free to use third-party components for low-level tasks.

### UI Description 
* User can add/remove/modify RSS feed sources. 
* News entities are displayed in a sectioned list (each section is a feed source with its title). 
* Show image, title, short description for each news article (in list). 
* Full news article should be rendered in a separate screen, opened by tap on a list item. 

### Optional features 
* Implement favorite feeds. There should be two lists: all feeds and favorite feeds. 
* Implement persistence of URLs to the feed sources in the local data storage. 
* Implement feeds search/filtering. 
* Implement navigation through news articles using swipe gesture in the article view screen. 
* Anything you like, but don't make it too complicated. 

### Expected behaviour 
* Application should be ready to handle network errors at any moment. 
* Application should be ready for "invalid" data (from user and from server). 
* Application should never freeze or crash.

### Evaluation criteria 
The app should be developed using the best practices applicable to commercial development and team work. Key crtiteia are: 
* Code architecture. 
* Code maintainability. 
* Code reliability. 
* Code reusability. 
* Code style. 
* Project structure and configuration. 

Quality prevails over the app functionality.

###  Submission 
Use any public git repository. Good history levels up your karma
